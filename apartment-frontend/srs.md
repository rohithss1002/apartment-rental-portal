Mini Project Brief: Residential Apartment Rental Portal

 Objective
• Public/Resident App (Angular 20): Browse flats, view amenities (gym, pool, parking), request
bookings, and view booking status.
• Admin Portal (Angular 20): Manage towers, units, amenities; approve or decline bookings;
manage tenants; and view occupancy & mock payment data.
• Backend (Flask): Provide REST APIs with authentication, PostgreSQL persistence, JWT-based
sessions, and Dockerized deployment.
This project will demonstrate a full-stack web solution covering UI, API, database, and
containerized deployment.
